# megatictactoe
a bigger tic tac toe made with bevy in an afternoon

## rules
- players take turns claiming cells
- when a player gets a three in a row in a mini-board, they claim it
- if a mini-board is full and no player has won it, it gets cleared (to prevent draws)
- players win by winning three mini-boards in a row
